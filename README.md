# C Basic

This repository contains the source code for the C programming basic course. Each branch represents one week of the course, and contains the following materials:

- `slides.pdf`: The slides for this week's lectures.
- `exercise/`: A directory containing the source code for all exercises.
- `week.rar`: A compressed archive of the week's exercises, to be submitted to the instructor.
- `README.md`: A file containing information about the exercises for the week, including the number of exercises, commit instructions, and deadline.

## File Structure

- The source code for each exercise should be stored in a separate file, named using the following convention: `ex[exercise number]-[part number].c`. 
  
  For example, the file for exercise 2.1 would be named `ex2-1.c`.

## Usage

To work on the exercises, navigate to the appropriate branch and follow the instructions provided in the README file within. When you are finished, make sure to commit your changes and push them to the repository.

To submit the exercises to the instructor, simply send the `week.rar` file as directed by the course instructor.

## Commit Instructions

- To upload new files: "upload [exercise numbers]" (e.g. "upload 2.1 2.2 2.3")
- To fix an existing file: "fix [exercise number]" (e.g. "fix 2.1")
- To delete a file: "delete [exercise number]" (e.g. "delete 2.1")

Remember to include a descriptive commit message explaining the changes you are making.

## Notes

- Be sure to read the instructions for each exercise carefully, and ask for help if you get stuck.
- Remember to commit and push your changes regularly, so that you have a history of your progress and can easily go back to previous versions if needed.
